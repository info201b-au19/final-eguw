## Domain of Interest
Our domain of interest is **Homelessness situation in Seattle**. In the Seattle King County area, there are about 12,500 homeless people living on the streets or in shelters. This not only makes the living environment of Seattle worse but also impacts the citizens' daily life(crime, policing, junk/RVs, harassment etc).
