# Project Brainstorm

## Topic
Our domain of interest is **Homelessness**. In the Seattle King County area, there are about 12,500 homeless people living on the streets or in shelters. This not only makes the living environment of Seattle worse but also impacts the citizens' daily life(crime, policing, junk/RVs, harassment etc). Confronted with this in our daily lives, we are interested in better understanding the issue locally and nationally including some of the factors contributing to it.

## Example Projects
  - [UW Urban Analytics - Housing Stability and Homelessness](https://urbanalytics.uw.edu/projects/housingstability/) Research seeking to decipher factors and services contributing to the housing stability of the homeless.
  - [Seattle/King County Point-In-Time Count of Persons Experiencing Homelessness](http://allhomekc.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/2019-Report_KingCounty_FINAL.pdf) An annual report from *All Home* intending to capture statistics on homelessness on a given night.
  - [How much do Seattle and King County spend on homelessness?](https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/homeless/how-much-do-seattle-and-king-county-spend-on-homelessness/) Seattle Times infographic illustrating how much is spent on homelessness, including it's sources and how it is spent.

## Questions to Answer
- How does cost of living impact the rate of various homeless populations?
  - Analyzing the homeless population relative to cost of living should give insight into how significant an impact cost of living has.  
- What is the impact of homeless populations on crime?
  - By comparing crime rates to homeless populations, we can identify any correlation that may exist between the two.
- How much of the homeless population can find shelter?
  - By comparing reported numbers of homeless population groups, we can identify trends with the portions of the population that find shelter.
